# Self-updating full and unfiltered list of Session Communities

## What is Session?

[Session](https://getsession.org/) is a private messaging app that protects your meta-data,
encrypts your communications, and makes sure your messaging activities
leave no digital trail behind.

## What are Session Communities? What does this project do?

Session Communities are public chatrooms accessible from within Session Messenger.
This web project crawls known sources of Session Communities, and 
displays information about them as a static HTML page.

This project is a fork of sessioncommunities.online (developed by https://codeberg.org/gravel) 
as the original website is no longer available in open source format 
and is also known for applying extensive filtering and censorship of certain community hosts.

Sessioncommunities.info website strives to maintain an unbiased, unfiltered and uncensored list of all known 
Session open communities that adhere to the Content Policy laid out in the Session Terms of Service
(https://getsession.org/terms-of-service).

Please contact BlackHouse (registered Session Account ID) on Session Messenger with listing application
or abuse reports concerning listed communities/hosts.
